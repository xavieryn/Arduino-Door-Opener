### Olin 2024 Fall Passion Pursuit
#### Was given $150 dollars to learn how to use electronics :D. I was able to better learn how electricity works and actually learn how to use electronics. Here I used an arduino to command a  dc motor controller, so I learned how an H-bridge works and how you a can control speed by the intervals of voltage (PWM) rather than just lowering the voltage (as it doesn't work like that). I deployed a vercel app once again, so that anyone who accesses the website can open the door :D. 
#### The motor is connected to a pinion where it pushes down the rack until it hits the first limit switch (where it is pushing down the door handle). Then it will wait for a small interval of time, then it will go back up until it hits the next limit switch (when its knows it is at the top.
#### I deployed a vercel app, but apparently you are not able to use BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) on chrome on IOS (Tested myself), but you are able to do it on an android (Tested with my brother's phone and it worked) This means I will probably have to use LightBlue which supports it (Already tested)

I just spent too long on this schematic :(

Anyone who can implement this can just clone the code from the repo and copy this schematic. :D

If you have any questions, please message me!
