### Olin 2024 Fall Passion Pursuit
#### Was given $150 dollars to learn how to use electronics :D. I was able to better learn how electricity works and actually learn how to use electronics. Here I used a dc motor controller, so I learned how an H-bridge works and how you able able to control speed by the intervals of voltage. I deployed another vercel app once again, so that anyone who accesses the website can open the door :D. 
#### I deployed a vercel app, but apparently you are not able to use BLE on chrome on IOS (Tested myself), but you are able to do it on an android (Tested with my brother's phone and it worked) This means I will probably have to use LightBlue which supports it (Already tested)

I just spent too long on this schematic :(

Anyone who can implement this can just clone the code from the repo and copy this schematic. :D

If you have any questions, please message me!
